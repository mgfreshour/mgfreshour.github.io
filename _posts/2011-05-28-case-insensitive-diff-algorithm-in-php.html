So, one day the business analyst wanted to compare what people where typing in as their address and the corrected/validated results we use.  My first thought was "Oh that'd be easy, we just use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> function on a report!"  What I didn't think about was that most people type in the lowercase, but the corrected address are in all caps (as per <a href="http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm">Post Office specs</a>).  <br />
<br />
Okay, so we just need a case insensitive diff algorithm, but wait, there's more.  "Marshal Hollow Rd" and "Maral Hollow Rd" only show up as a tiny difference, but obviously they're completely different addresses.  We needed to highlight the differences in the words more.  So, now we need a case insensitive diff that judges differences based on words rather than characters.<br />
<br />
What follows was my solution to this need.  I wrote this a number of years ago, and I no longer remember much about it.  I do know that I did <strong>not</strong> invent the diff algorithm.  There was a comment with this <a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/2006/01/16/comparing-strings-an-analysis-of-diff-algorithms/">link</a> in it. Likely I just wrote what is said on that page and modified it to handle our special needs.  If I read the website in the comment and studied the code, I could probably regain my understanding of this algorithm, but I don't think I really need to understand it anymore as in the intervening years I've not needed a similar algorithm since.<br />
<br />
Here's the code!<br />
<br />
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:php"><![CDATA[
<?php

    $orig_old = explode(' ', $old);
    $translate_new = array();
    $translate_old = array();
    for ($n = 0; $n < sizeof($orig_new); $n++) {
        $translate_new[$cap_new[$n]] = $orig_new[$n];
    }
    for ($n = 0; $n < sizeof($orig_old); $n++) {
        $translate_old[$cap_old[$n]] = $orig_old[$n];
    }
    
    $differences = $this->wordDiff($cap_old, $cap_new);
    
    foreach ($differences as $diff) {
        if (is_array($diff)) {

                $ret .= implode(' ', $new_diff);
                $ret .= $diff_suffix;
            }
        } else
            $ret .= $translate_new[$diff].' ';

                $nmax = $nindex + 1 - $maxlen;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if ($maxlen == 0) {

    }
    
    return array_merge($this->wordDiff(array_slice($old, 0, $omax), array_slice($new, 0, $nmax)), array_slice($new, $nmax, $maxlen),
